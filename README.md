This is a simple and hopefully self-explanatory thingee for running "plugins".

Basically, I was working on a project and needed a way to execute a list of defined actions in each controller. Then that project got cancelled.

Then I re-used it on another project, which also got cancelled.

Then I re-used it a third time. So far that project has not been cancelled, nor has it fallen over and sank into the swamp, but the scope of the project ballooned until we ended up needing more than this code provided, and the chosen framework had something we could adapt.
